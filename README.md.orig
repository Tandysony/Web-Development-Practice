### HTML and CSS

#### HTML


#### CSS

 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language that describes the presentation of an HTML (or XML) document. CSS describes how elements must be rendered on screen, on paper, or in other media. The reason why we use CSS to separate the presentation layer of our page way from functional part that we may use JavaScript to add rich functionality to the page and markup as well.

* Use `#` to target a `ID` defined in HTML files; use `.` to target a `class` defined in HTML files; just use the element name, e.g., `body`, `h1`, for an `element` in HTML files.
