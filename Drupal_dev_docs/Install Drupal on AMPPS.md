## Requirements
1. AMPPS
2. Drupal 7
3. Window 7/8/10 or Mac OS X or Linux

#### 1. Download and install AMPPS

AMPPS is a solution stack of Apache, MySQL, MongoDB, PHP, Perl & Python for Windows, Linux and Mac. It enables you to provide local host for local web development. You might have experienced MAMP on Mac OS, WAMP on Windows, or LAMP for Linux. However, it is more likely to pop up errors when sync website/database between machines. With AMPPS across all platforms, it ensures that database version and structure (i.e., table prefix) are exactly the same regardless of the OS.

 * Download [AMPPS](http://www.ampps.com/)
 * Install it on your PC or Mac

#### 2. Run the AMPPS and start Apache and MySQL

#### 5. Configure Drupal settings other than the defaults
 * **5.1.** `Drupal 7.41` is chosen since majority of the modules are not ported to Drupal 8 as of the time of writing.  
 * **5.2.** For `In Directory`, leave it blank if you are going to host ONLY one website, or a meaningful name (e.g., `loc.jidps.com`) for possible multiple website. I left it blank just for simplicity. *[You can change it later if you left it blank at the beginning]*
 * **5.3.** Use `JIDPS` for `Site Name`.
 * **5.4.** In `Advanced Options`, choose a proper name (lower case is recommanded) for `Database Name`, e.g., `jidps` is used in this case. In AMPPS, the default database username is `root` and default database password is `mysql`. They are critical for later website sync among multiple computers. They cannot be changed here at installing phase, but can be later.
 * **5.5.** Use a rarely used email for `Admin Email` and/or `Email installation details to:` field(s).

#### 7. Launch your local website one installed successfully

 * Click the installed link `http://127.0.0.1` or input `http://localhost/` your web browser to see your local webpage. Please note that, if you input a directory name in `Step 5.2`, you need to include it as well, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1/loc.jidps.com` or input `http://localhost/loc.jidps.com`
