## Prerequisite
1. AMPPS installed
2. Drupal 7 installed

## Website Development with Drupal
In this demo, website folder is named `loc.jidps.com`.

### 1. Drupal 7 blocks and region structure
 * A webpage structure in Drupal 7 is shown in the following figure

### 2. Themes
 * Download [themes](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_theme)

### 3. Modules
 * Unzip your theme and modules, and put them under the respective folder (`themes` or `modules`) under the `loc.jidps.com/sites/all` folder.
 * Some must have modules for Drupal 7:

    * [Pathauto](https://www.drupal.org/node/17345)
    * [Token](https://www.drupal.org/project/token)
    * [CTools](https://www.drupal.org/project/ctools)
    * [Views](https://www.drupal.org/project/views)
    * [CKEditor](https://www.drupal.org/project/ckeditor)
    * [Module Filter](https://www.drupal.org/project/module_filter)
    * [Media](https://www.drupal.org/project/media)
    * [Administration menu](https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_menu)
    * [Entity API](https://www.drupal.org/project/entity)
    * [Backup and Migrate](https://www.drupal.org/project/backup_migrate)

### 4. Views
 * Understand the core concept `View` in Drupal: [View - Formats & Pagers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDWs0ij6Dt0&index=25&list=PL15BE2E8313A4E809)

### 5. Taxonomy
 * xxx
 * To configure multi-layer taxonomy pattern, go to `Configuration` --> `Search and metadata` --> `URL aliases` --> `TAXONOMY TERM PATHS`: under `Default path pattern`, fill in `[term:vocabulary]/[term:parents:join-path]/[term:name]`

## On Use
 * set and configure **roles**: `People` --> `Permissions` --> `Roles`
 * set and configure **categories**: `Structure` --> `Taxonomy`
 * set and configure **status**: `Configuration` --> `Workbench` --> `States`
 * configure **transations**: `Configuration` --> `Workbench` --> `Transations`

## Some thoughts
#### 1. Use `custom menu` for role selection
#### 2. Use [Workbench Suite](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/modules/workbench) for JIDPS website development. Here is an [introduction tutorial](https://modulesunraveled.com/workbench)
#### 3. Using `rules` and `Workbench_moderation`
 * **Event**: `After saving new content` (also tried `after moderation transition`)
 * **Conditons**: `Content is using workbench moderation` and `contents current moderation state`.
 * **Actions**: send mail `node:author:mail` (that the new content has been moderated and published)
 * **Data Viz**: visualize data.

## Frequent Q/As

#### 1. Having `?q=` in URLs even with `Pathauto` module enabled?
 * You need to make sure `LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so` in the `httpd.conf` file is uncomment out, no leading `#`.

    ![enable rewrite module](img/Apache_modules.png)

* Go to `http://localhost/loc.jidps.com/?q=admin/config/search/clean-urls` and check `Enable clean URLs`

#### 2. `CKEditor V4.5.X` could not be detected by `wysiwyg v7.x-2.2` module?
  * Open `\sites\all\libraries\ckeditor\ckeditor.js` file in a text editor.
  * Add `// version:'4.4.3',revision:'4391'` in first line and save it.

#### 3. Sync a localhost website to multiple machines?

> **Do NOT fully rely on the `Backup and Migrate` module to sync your entire website among multiple machines. Too shame that Drupal released the Backup and Migrate module (7.x-3.1) that is not functional well at the time of writing (Jan. 12, 2016), even with patches applied. It raised all kinds of issues all over the Internet, even the patches installed. Here I provide a way to baypass the restore function working like a charm.**

 > **Please also be noted that the sync process is based on the `AMPPS` software, to ensure that database version and structure (i.e., table prefix) are exactly the same across all computers, no matter running MAC OS, Windows or Linux.**

  * **3.1.** Backup your database and website

  * The `Back and Migrate` module does not work with `Entire Site (code, files & DB)` restore option. Here is my solution:
    1. Use the `Back and Migrate` module to `Download` the `Defualt Database` (NOT `Entire Site (code, files & DB)`).

        ![backup and migrate](img/backup_migrate.png)

    2. Copy the database backup file (e.g., `xxx.mysql.gz`) and your entire drupal website folder (all files under the `..\Ampps\www` directory) to your USB drive or a cloud drive (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox).
    3. Visit your `phpMyAdmin` page on a different computer, choose your current database (`drup599` in this case) being used for Drupal website development, and `Import` from your database backup file (`xxx.mysql.gz`). Then paste you whole website into you new local `www` folder.

        ![database restore](img/database_restore.png)

    4. Open the `settings.php` file under the directory `www\sites\default\`. Be sure that `databse ==> xxx` has the same name of current local database (`drup599` in this case). Change the values to `username` and `password` to `root` and `mysql` respectively.
        ```php
        $databases = array (
        'default' =>
          array (
            'default' =>
            array (
              'database' => 'drup599',
              'username' => 'root',
              'password' => 'mysql',
              'host' => 'localhost',
              'port' => '',
              'driver' => 'mysql',
              'prefix' => 'dr_',
            ),
          ),
        );
        ```

    5. Then visit your website and click `Flush all cashes` from the top tool bar. You are now synced your website between two machines.
